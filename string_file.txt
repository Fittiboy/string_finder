This file has "a bunch of strings." Those "strings" are denoted by \" (without the \ of course) surrounding them.
If there is a backslash in front of a double quote inside a string "like \" this" for example, the string is not terminated!
Strings could also be surrounded by any matching number of double quotes, \""""like this triple quoted one!"""
Note that there is an escaped double quote at the beginning, which should "not count towards the total.
Multi-line strings" should also work!
Of course, you can put any smaller number of quotes in a """triple-double quoted string ""Like this"" too!"""
